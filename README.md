# Machine Learning Cancer-Predicting Algorithm
This project will primarily utilize the Python libraries Scikit-learn and TensorFlow. Hopefully, these models will be capable of predicting the diagnosis of various cancers such as colorectal, pancreatic, breast, etc., with high accuracy. Data is provided by the National Cancer Institute. This is an independant project for ISEF 2023
